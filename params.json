It is based on a monolithic HTML file that \r\ncontains CSS, Javascript, and HTML. You should edit widget.html to represent \r\nyour content and functionality.\r\n\r\n### Running / Testing\r\n\r\nThis widget can be run from Cloud9 by launching the nodetestserver.js Test Web \r\nServer by right-clicking the file and choosing \"Run\" and then navigating to the \r\nnon-SSL URL of \r\n```\r\nhttp://yourworkspace-youruser.c9users.io/widget.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo run this widget from ChiliPeppr you should use the following command:\r\n```\r\nchilipeppr.load(\r\n    \"#myDivToInsertContentInto\", \r\n    \"http://yourworkspace-youruser.c9users.io/widget.html\", \r\n    function() { \r\n        /* This is the callback function called after the \r\n        load is complete. You typically place code that \r\n        finds your widget library that would now be in \r\n        memory via cprequire() \r\n        */ \r\n    } \r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that SSL does not work for ChiliPeppr yet since so many files and \r\nURL pointers point to non-SSL URL's. If you try to pull up your widget via SSL \r\nyou get a bunch of errors due to the mixed SSL and non-SSL. So, just a heads up.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
